This is the code to support the paper "Multi-purpose neural network for French categorial grammars", GaÃ«tan Margueritte, Daisuke Bekki, Koji Mineshima, submitted to IWCS2023 (to appear in IWCS proceedings in June).

  

#### *Please note that the dataset provided is extracted from the TLGBank by Richard Moot (https://www.labri.fr/perso/moot/TLGbank/) in order to allow the results to be reproducible.

## Installation

In order to run the project, we recommend you to use a virtual environment.

```

python3 -m venv py3

source py3/bin/activate

```

You can download dependencies automatically using `poetry`.

```

poetry install --no-root

```

It is recommended to install the correct version of `cuda` for your working station.

  
  

## Running the program

In order to train the neural model, please run the following command:

```

python3 train.py

```

You can also change the default parameters available using the command line, such as the batch size or the seed. For more information on arguments, please use the `-h` option.

```

python3 train.py -h

```

Files used during training:

-  `train.py` organizes the training phase of the model ;

-  `model.py` defines the architecture of the model ;

-  `tlgbank.txt` input file containing the training data ;

-  `dataHandle.py` contains methods used to loading data into Python structures ;

-  `utils.py` various utilities such as padding.

  

## Results and outputs

  

Running the program will create the following files:

-  `evaluation/temp/unrecognized_tags.txt`, the list of expected tags that were not recognized during evaluation. Used to identify that most tags are really complex (thus rare) ;

- several model files used to restart training from a selected phase (given as argument )

-- `model.pt` phase 1 trained model (`python3 train.py --model model.pt`) ;

-- `vae_model.pt` phase 2 trained model (`python3 train.py --vae-model vae_model.pt`) ;

-- `final_model.pt` phrase 3 trained model (no command, as no training is required) ;

-  `model_data.pickle` data used for model initialization, used to manually test sentences using `main.py`

  

Prints such as training statistics are indicated in `stdout` terminal. Loss and accuracy per tag class (e.g. Uncommon, Rare) for training/evaluation/test are presented.

  

## Tagging custom sentences

You can test custom sentences formulated in French using `main.py` and a trained model. To do so, please use the following command:

```

python3 main.py --model [trained model file] --data [model data pickle file] --input [input sentences in .txt format]

```

  

Examples are provided in the file `input.txt`.
